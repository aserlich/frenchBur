Current issues

1. There is a minor problem in distinguishing name text and other text, when Abbyy Lingvo reads a caps name as lower case
	Places where there are multiple names on one line or no rank between them -RES[These are coded with a name flag]
	(e.g) Richard martinez Serge maurel -- 
 	Pascal LEMAIRE Benoît PIGUET Rachel CHANE SEE CHU François ARSAC Patrick FEVRIER Lionel MOISY-DE-CALA
2. There are names where there are duel appointments and we only catpure the first name (e.g,Georges garioud and Nicolas MOLFESSIS)
	We currently don't have Niclas MOLFESSIS

Notes
1. There are a few multiple appointments, e.g, Sébastien SEGARRA. This shouldn't be a problem
3. There are few officials with one name (e.g, GHESTEM on page 303 only has one name, VAEZ-OLIVERA on page 409 only has one name)
	Just to document that that occures
